**HNF4A** The protein encoded by this gene is a nuclear transcription factor which binds DNA as a homodimer.
The encoded protein controls the expression of several genes, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha,
a transcription factor which regulates the expression of several hepatic genes. This gene may play a role in development
of the liver, kidney, and intestines. Mutations in this gene have been associated with monogenic autosomal dominant 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type I. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript 
variants encoding several different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2012]

The ClinGen community have specific flowchart to classify HNF4A variants as PVS1

This app will pull variant info from VEP API, look at the exon number, variant consequence, cds end and will assess if the variant provided meets the PVS1 
OR NOT.In addition, this app will also get the gene name, protein effect and
